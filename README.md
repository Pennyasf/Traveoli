# XploreWebsite
This is a website I co-developed along with Fsewell1, as part of an end of course project with code first: girls.
(Code First: Girls "works with companies and with men and women directly, to help increase the number of women in tech" [https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/] and I attended one of these courses in the beginning of 2018 with 100% attendance to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript).

This website specifically is an early idea of a food travel blog where you post recipes for meals from different countries.
